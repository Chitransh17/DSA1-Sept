# Bipartite Graph :
   1. If it is possible to divide all the vertices into 2 mutually exclusive or exhaustive sets such that all edges are across sets then we say the graph is bipartite.
   2. For even length cyclic graph. Graph can be bipartite but for odd length cyclic graph. Graph can never be bipartite.

# Minimum Spanning Tree :
   1. Its a graph Subgraph (Subgraph is basically picking some edges and vertices).
   2. It is like a tree.
   3. It's a connected graph such that we can travel from one vertices to another vertices directyl or indirectly.
   4. It ia ascylcic graph.
   5. Spanning : In spanning we have to choose all vertices but we can leave some edges
   6. So Minimum Spanning Tree is a graph where all the vertices are connected indirectly or directly and over all weight o the graph is minimum.

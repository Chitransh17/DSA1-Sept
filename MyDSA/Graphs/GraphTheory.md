# Bipartite Graph :
   1. If it is possible to divide all the vertices into 2 mutually exclusive or exhaustive sets such that all edges are across sets then we say the graph is bipartite.
   2. For even vertices cyclic graph. Graph can be bipartite but for odd vertices cyclic graph. Graph can never be bipartite.
